other relevant factors relating to the Services provided under this Agreement to the Trustees

appropriate, to you in your capacity as Trustee(s) and/or the Trust.

Scope of services
Accounts

We will prepare annual accounts for years ending 5 April with effect from 5 April 2019 for approval by
you.

In fulfilling our responsibilities, we will be acting as accountants and not as auditors. In particular, we
shall not, as we would in the case of an audit, express any opinion on the results disclosed in the
accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

Where, in this Agreement, we refer to "you", "your" or "yours", these words shall be read to refer, as
appropriate, to you in your capacity as Trustee(s) and/or the Trust.

Scope of services
Accounts

We will prepare annual accounts for years ending 5 April with effect from 5 April 2019 for approval by
you.

In fulfilling our responsibilities, we will be acting as accountants and not as auditors. In particular, we
shall not, as we would in the case of an audit, express any opinion on the results disclosed in the
accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

any enquiry should you so request. We will charge additional fees for such work on a time and expenses
basis as set out in section 1 of the Fees - additional terms and conditions below, unless otherwise
agreed.

EY, the other EY Firms and our respective service providers may Process Client Information obtained in connection with Services performed for you, including Target Information (but only from and after the consummation of the Transaction), for benchmarking, research, thought leadership, and to enhance the services we provide to you and other clients, provided that we do not identify you or any individuals related to you, or otherwise make reference to you, in connection with these matters.


&. Tax documents

We will own all correspondence or other documents which are either created or produced by us during
the course of our engagement or received by us from the tax authorities or any other third party in our

capacity as your tax representative, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

There is an HMRC requirement to retain copies of returns and all supporting records and information for
a period of 22 months from the end of the tax year in question. If any return is queried by HMRC, the
relevant supporting records and information are required to be kept until the conclusion of the enquiry
(where this is.later than the normal retention period referred to in the previous sentence).

This Statement of Work describes the scope of our professional services (the ‘Services’), our fees and
other relevant factors relating to the Services provided under this Agreement to the Trustees

Where, in this Agreement, we refer to "you", "your" or "yours", these words shall be read to refer, as
appropriate, to you in your capacity as Trustee(s) and/or the Trust.

Scope of services
Accounts

We will prepare annual accounts for years ending 5 April with effect from 5 April 2019 for approval by
you.

In fulfilling our responsibilities, we will be acting as accountants and not as auditors. In particular, we
shall not, as we would in the case of an audit, express any opinion on the results disclosed in the
accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

Where, in this Agreement, we refer to "you", "your" or "yours", these words shall be read to refer, as
appropriate, to you in your capacity as Trustee(s) and/or the Trust.

Scope of services
Accounts

We will prepare annual accounts for years ending 5 April with effect from 5 April 2019 for approval by
you.

In fulfilling our responsibilities, we will be acting as accountants and not as auditors. In particular, we
shall not, as we would in the case of an audit, express any opinion on the results disclosed in the
accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

any enquiry should you so request. We will charge additional fees for such work on a time and expenses
basis as set out in section 1 of the Fees - additional terms and conditions below, unless otherwise
agreed.

EY, the other EY Firms and our respective service providers may Process Client Information obtained in connection with Services performed for you, including Target Information (but only from and after the consummation of the Transaction), for benchmarking, research, thought leadership, and to enhance the services we provide to you and other clients, provided that we do not identify you or any individuals related to you, or otherwise make reference to you, in connection with these matters.


&. Tax documents

We will own all correspondence or other documents which are either created or produced by us during
the course of our engagement or received by us from the tax authorities or any other third party in our

capacity as your tax representative, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

There is an HMRC requirement to retain copies of returns and all supporting records and information for
a period of 22 months from the end of the tax year in question. If any return is queried by HMRC, the
relevant supporting records and information are required to be kept until the conclusion of the enquiry
(where this is.later than the normal retention period referred to in the previous sentence).

Where, in this Agreement, we refer to "you", "your" or "yours", these words shall be read to refer, as
appropriate, to you in your capacity as Trustee(s) and/or the Trust.

Scope of services
Accounts

We will prepare annual accounts for years ending 5 April with effect from 5 April 2019 for approval by
you.

In fulfilling our responsibilities, we will be acting as accountants and not as auditors. In particular, we
shall not, as we would in the case of an audit, express any opinion on the results disclosed in the
accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

Where, in this Agreement, we refer to "you", "your" or "yours", these words shall be read to refer, as
appropriate, to you in your capacity as Trustee(s) and/or the Trust.

Scope of services
Accounts

We will prepare annual accounts for years ending 5 April with effect from 5 April 2019 for approval by
you.

In fulfilling our responsibilities, we will be acting as accountants and not as auditors. In particular, we
shall not, as we would in the case of an audit, express any opinion on the results disclosed in the
accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

agreed.

EY, the other EY Firms and our respective service providers may Process Client Information obtained in connection with Services performed for you, including Target Information (but only from and after the consummation of the Transaction), for benchmarking, research, thought leadership, and to enhance the services we provide to you and other clients, provided that we do not identify you or any individuals related to you, or otherwise make reference to you, in connection with these matters.


&. Tax documents

We will own all correspondence or other documents which are either created or produced by us during
the course of our engagement or received by us from the tax authorities or any other third party in our

capacity as your tax representative, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

There is an HMRC requirement to retain copies of returns and all supporting records and information for
a period of 22 months from the end of the tax year in question. If any return is queried by HMRC, the
relevant supporting records and information are required to be kept until the conclusion of the enquiry
(where this is.later than the normal retention period referred to in the previous sentence).

accounts. Our accountants’ report will state only that the accounts have been prepared from the
accounting records and information and explanations supplied to us.

Your responsibilities

Unless we are already in possession of such information, you will ensure that any income, receipts or
payments, asset acquisitions or disposals, expense payments, distributions or other transactions relating
to the Trust are notified to us by 31 July following the end of the accounting period to enable us to
prepare accounts.

You are responsible for ensuring that the accounts which we prepare are reviewed carefully and
approved.

You will provide us with suitable letters of authority to enable us to correspond with your other agents
directly. We will let you know when we require such letters. In addition, you will advise us of any
beneficial appointments or resignations and appointments of trustees as they occur.


We will preparé computations of income tax and capital gains tax liabilities for inclusion in the annual
accounts. Ve will prepare tax returns for you to sign and provide tax calculations. This Agreement shall
govern tax compliance work carried out by us from the date of this Agreement.


Payments on account of income tax for a tax year are normally based on the income tax liability of the
previous tax year. It is possibie to apply to HMRC for such payments to be reduced on the basis that the
liability of the current tax year is expected to be lower than that of the previous year. However, as we will
not necessarily be aware of changes in your income without being advised by you, it is essential that you
notify us as soon as possible of any expected reduction in taxable income, or increase in allowable
expenditure, so that we may liaise with you and, if appropriate, apply for a reduction in the tax to be paid
on account, or a repayment of tax already paid. Should you be entitled to such a reduction or repayment,
itis also essential that we are notified of any subsequent increases in taxable income or reductions in
allowable expenditure since these may require payments on account to be revised again. We will not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from the over reduction of your payments
on account.

We will endeavour to obtain details of your position for prior tax years, including details of tax payments
due under the points noted above, from your previous agent (where applicable). However, you will be
responsible for ensuring that we receive all relevant information relating to prior years.

We shall also notify HMRC of any necessary adjustments after receipt of actual details where estimates
have been included in the tax return or where arithmetical errors have occurred. We shall not be
responsible for any interest, penalties or surcharges resulting from any such adjustments which are
outside of our control.

5. Enquiry procedures

If HMRC wishes to enquire into a tax return it wili issue a notice of enquiry. We will be happy to deal with
any enquiry should you so request. We will charge additional fees for such work on a time and expenses
basis as set out in section 1 of the Fees - additional terms and conditions below, unless otherwise
agreed.

EY, the other EY Firms and our respective service providers may Process Client Information obtained in connection with Services performed for you, including Target Information (but only from and after the consummation of the Transaction), for benchmarking, research, thought leadership, and to enhance the services we provide to you and other clients, provided that we do not identify you or any individuals related to you, or otherwise make reference to you, in connection with these matters.


&. Tax documents

We will own all correspondence or other documents which are either created or produced by us during
the course of our engagement or received by us from the tax authorities or any other third party in our

capacity as your tax representative, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

There is an HMRC requirement to retain copies of returns and all supporting records and information for
a period of 22 months from the end of the tax year in question. If any return is queried by HMRC, the
relevant supporting records and information are required to be kept until the conclusion of the enquiry
(where this is.later than the normal retention period referred to in the previous sentence).
